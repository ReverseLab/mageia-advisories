   core:
     - rubygem-passenger-3.0.21-2.mga3
description: |
  Phusion Passengerâ€™s code did not always create temporary files and directories
  in a secure manner. Temporary files and directories were sometimes created
  with a predictable filename. A local attacker can pre-create temporary files,
  resulting in a denial of service. In addition, this vulnerability allows a
  local attacker to run arbitrary code as another user, by hijacking temporary
  files (CVE-2013-2119).

  The rubygem-passenger package has been upgraded to version 3.0.21, which fixes
  this issue, as well as many others although at the moment has some issues 
  which will be fixed with a further update (mga#10728).
