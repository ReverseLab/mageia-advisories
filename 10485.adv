  XBMC 12.2 contains fixes to various issues. See the referenced
  announcement for a list of the most important ones. Additionally, this
  update fixes video playback issues experienced with the NVIDIA proprietary
  driver version 319.17 (Mageia bug #10485).

  This update also fixes A/V lipsync issues experienced by some people,
  especially when a 24Hz refresh rate was configured.

  Also, file names with spaces will now work properly when opened externally
  in XBMC using "Open with..." or when entering the name directly from
  command line (Mageia bug #2331) .

  The PVR addons have also been updated.

  VDR plugin "vnsiserver" is also updated to a version compatible with the
  current version of XBMC.
